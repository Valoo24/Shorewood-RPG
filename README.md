# Shorewood-RPG

Shorewood-RPG is a small project that I made while I was in training for learning .NET. It's a small role-playing I made in three days after only a month of training. The game runs on the console and
have quite a few bugs I didn't corrected. Ther's also some unnecessary inputs the player can make for features I didn't had the time to implement. Even though the project is not perfect, it's still playable
and enjoyable (at least for me). If this project is not representative of my current skills in .NET, it is still a nice timestamp of what I did in the past. Have fun if you download this project, and don't
hesitate to improve the game over my code if you wish to !
